To quickly recap the range() function when passing one, two, or three parameters:

    One parameter will create a sequence, one-by-one, from zero to one less than the parameter.
    Two parameters will create a sequence, one-by-one, from the first parameter to one less than the second parameter.
    Three parameters will create a sequence starting with the first parameter and stopping before the second parameter, 
         but this time increasing each step by the third parameter.
