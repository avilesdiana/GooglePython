list = ["This", "is", "a", "list"]. 

-Use the len() function to return the number of elements in a list: 
len(list) would return 4. 

-Use the in keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. 
If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. 
For example, "This" in list would return True in our example. 

-Use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing list[0], 
which would allow you to access the string "This".

Theyâ€™re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, like:
(1) being able to iterate over them using for loops; 
(2) support indexing; 
(3) using the len function to find the length of the sequence; 
(4) using the plus operator + in order to concatenate;
(5) using the in keyword to check if the sequence contains a value.
